# DeepLearning-Practice

Model for deeplearning project :
 - MLP from scratch for regression task using energy efficiency dataset and classification task using ionoshphere dataset 
 - CNN for image recognition/classification using MNIST & CIFAR-10 dataset
 - RNN & LSTM for natural language processing to generate paragraph/sentences of shakesphere novel
 - CNN for hand gesture classification (rock, paper, scissors) - Dicoding beginner project
 - BiLSTM for natural language processing on BBC news classification
 - BiLSTM for multivariate time series forecasting on action recognition (walking, jumping, standing, falling)
 - Resnet15v2(Transfer Learning) + MLP for image classification of 10 classes google openimagesv6 dataset.
